# What is Spartan?

The University of Melbourne's general purpose hybrid traditional high performance computing system (HPC) with cloud instances from the NeCTAR Research Cloud and attached Research Data Storage Services (RDSS).

It is designed to suit the needs of researchers whose desktop/laptop is not up to the particular task. Models running slow, datasets are too big, not enough cores, application licensing issues, etc.

Spartan consists of:

*  a management node for system administrators,
*  a login node for users to connect to the system and submit jobs,
*  a small number of 'bare metal' compute nodes for multinode tasks,
*  any 'bare metal' user-procured hardware (e.g., departmental nodes),
*  vHPC cloud compute nodes for overflow and GPGPU tasks, and
*  general cloud compute nodes.

# Accessing Spartan

## Getting an Account

To gain access to Spartan you need to create an account.

*  Via Karaage at [link](https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/karaage)
*  Need to create a project
+  Needs a project leader (you), and you can invite collaborators for joint projects
+  Needs a project title/description to demonstrate research goals and/or research support 
*  Takes ~2 days for approval

## Required Programs

To connnect to Spartan you will need a Secure Shell (SSH) and a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) client. The SSH client is your interface with Spartan while the SFTP client is used to transfer files from your local computer to your Spartan home directory.

### Windows Users

Use PuTTY as your SSH client. This is an easy set-up with the following five steps:

1.  Set your host name: spartan.hpc.unimelb.edu.au
2.  Set your port number: leave as default (whereas Boab users need a defined port)
3.  Set your connection type: SSH
4.  Name your session to make it easy for future log-ins: Whatever you like i.e. Spartan
5.  Save your session details

Your first log-in to Spartan via the SSH client creates your home directory on Spartan so it is important to do that before setting up your SFTP client.

Use WinSCP as your SFTP client. This is an easy process with the following six steps:

1.  Set your file protocol: SFTP
2.  Set your hhost name: spartan.hpc.unimelb.edu.au
3.  Set your port number:leave as default (whereas Boab users need a defined port)
4.  Enter your username
5.  Enter your password (note, this will show more characters than you entered when saved)
6.  Login

Inside a WinSCP session you will have dual file explorer windows: your local machine (left) and your Spartan home directory). If you have not made your initial log-in to Spartan via your SSH client you will have a blank white screen in the right-hand window. Transferring files between the two directories is with a simple drag-and-drop interface.

Your two clients are now set up and everything is ready to access Spartan. After set-up you don't need to directly deal with PuTTy anymore as there is a button in the WinSCP toolbar to open a session.

### Mac/Linux Users

See Nick

## SLURM Files
•	Creating your SLURM file:
o	Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management
o	This is where you set the resource parameters for the model run
o	Best to do so in Notepad++ (for Windows users only?) due to difference in end of line notation between Oss.
o	Series of #SBATCH commands
o	List common examples
•	Modifying your code files:
o	As Spartan runs on linux you may need to de-Windows-ify the code
o	/ or \ in file paths is OS dependant
o	Line end notation
•	Now that you have all of the pieces, putting it together and submitting to Spartan
o	Open SSH client
o	Log-in
o	Either sbatch or sinteractive gets you out of Log-in node and into a compute node
	Don’t run models in log-in node or admins will get upset and kill your job
o	Sbatch is a direct command (i.e. queue this model)
	Sbatch filename.slurm
o	Sinteractive lets you do things step by step
	Sinteractive
	Module load R
	R
	Filename
	Lets you test that things work as intended on Spartan before submitting a job to queue
o	Useful commands:
	Squeue -u <username>
•	Lets you see the status of all of your jobs
	Squeue -u <username> -t RUNNING (or PENDING
	Scancel <jobid>
•	Cancel particular job
	Scancel -u <username>
•	Cancel all of your jobs
	Scancel -t PENDING -u <username>
•	Cancel all pending jobs
	Man <function name>
•	Look at manual for function. Like ?in R
•	Man spartan
	scontrol show jobid -d <jobid>
•	detailed information on jobs
	sstat --format=AveCPU,AvePages,AveRSS,AveVMSize,JobID -j <jobid> --allsteps
•	information on currently running jobs
	sacct -j <jobid> --format=JobID,JobName,MaxRSS,Elapsed
	sacct -u <username> --format=JobID,JobName,MaxRSS,Elapsed
•	these two provide additional information on completed jobs i.e. runtime, memory used, etc
•	Other commands that I need to explore further:
o	Salloc and srun for parallelisation
